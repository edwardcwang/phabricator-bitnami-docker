Proof-of-concept Dockerfile for running Phabricator with the Bitnami Dockerfile.

Uses https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-phabricator for the Phabricator install with the upstream MariaDB container.

This docker setup isn't super ideal so in the future maybe using a fully custom Dockerfile would be better (see `Dockerfile`).
